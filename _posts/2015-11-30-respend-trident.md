[Re-Spend Trident][RT] is a prototype for a standalone news app site made in response to news of the [massively overrunning costs][OC] of the Trident nuclear weapons renewal programme.

The intention was to make an interactive site which would provoke users to think about the cost in relative terms: not as a sum of money in isolation, but as a huge chunk of the public budget which could have been spent on other services.

The project uses [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) to receive values from UI elements, and draws a tree map using the [D3plus](http://d3plus.org/) library, a simplified and more user-friendly version of [D3](http://d3js.org/).

The webpage is also designed to be fully responsive and provide a well-considered user experience even on small mobile screens, by using the [Bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com/) for stylesheets and components.

I started writing my first blog five years ago, in 2010, when I travelled solo in India for the second time. In the grand scheme of things it wasn’t much - a few anecdotes, a handful of photos - but it felt satisfying to be producing and uploading my own content, to my schedule, on a domain that I controlled.

In the years between then and now I’ve always been working with digital media in some capacity. First I was creating digital art with a collective in Bangalore, then heading up editorial content for the (sadly-now-defunct) [Urban Times](http://www.urbantimes.co "Urban Times"), and over the past two years, leading on tech development strategy for a citizen journalism NGO, [On Our Radar](http://www.onourradar.org).

Around that I’ve completed a Masters in sociology at Goldsmiths (developing an [app for homeless young people](https://mobilelives.atavist.com/) as a thesis project), participated in various international conferences, and published articles in a variety of places as a freelance.

Though I can confidently say I’ve ‘worked in journalism’ for years, I usually stop short of calling myself a journalist. In any case, though I’ve always admired great research and great writing, it’s not what excites me most about the craft of journalism in the 21st century.

The projects that really captivate me are the ones that sit at the intersection of design, research and interaction; the projects where a great story or commentary is also told through great UX. The NYT's ['Snowfall'](http://www.nytimes.com/projects/2012/snow-fall/#/?part=tunnel-creek) paved the way back in 2012, but it's been followed by an explosion of stories that make use of similarly interactive presentation formats.

(There are too many to name - and I'll write more about it later - but as far as big names go, [The Guardian's data team](http://www.theguardian.com/data) are second to none here, and [Knight Lab](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/) does an incredible job of creating and promoting open source tools).

For a long time I've wanted to make stories like this: to have the skills not just to interview, write, and photograph, but also to explore datasets, map variables, and build websites to display the results. I don’t want to ditch the writing part - just add to it. That’s why in my head at least, it's not just 'data journalism' or 'web journalism' but ‘full stack journalism’: being able to operate comfortably at all points of the spectrum.

In August 2015 my contract with On Our Radar expired, and four weeks later I completed my Masters. Come September, I found myself in a rare situation: facing a completely clean break from everything I’d been doing over the past 2 years.

So, having been given a rare chance to plan my next steps from scratch, I decided to make the most of it by taking a sabbatical for a few months to set myself a crash course in the skills that I’ve been meaning to learn for a long time. I'll be writing in depth about exactly what I've decided to learn and how I plan to do it later, so I won't go into more detail just yet.

Suffice to say, there's quite a journey ahead, but this is how I got to here.

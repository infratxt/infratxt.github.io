Now I’m a little further into the first month of training, I wanted to take more time to break down exactly what my vision of "full-stack journalism" is.

As far as I know, I came up with the term a few months ago without having heard it anywhere else first. As far as I can see, it has already been used on a handful of occasions in other parts of the Web but doesn’t have much currency as yet. In short, I can’t claim to have invented it but I’ve got a good shot at defining what it means. (To me at least.)

In software terms, a full-stack developer is someone who can operate at all points of the software production spectrum, from **writing back end code**, to **managing data and databases**, to **designing user interfaces**, to **working directly with clients** and **managing projects**.

So in looking critically at my own work and skillset, I wanted to borrow from those ideas to think about what a journalist would look like if they were able to work at all points of the media production spectrum.

From where I am at the moment, here’s what I consider to be areas that a 'full-stack journalist' would need to operate across, and an assessment of where I am in relation to that. 

Let's start with some skills that I currently have, with ratings:

* **Writing**: strong. Eight years’ experience (on and off) of blogging, column writing, academic essays, organisational reports, and a handful of published poems and short stories.
* **Photography**: fair-to-good. I’ve been taking photos for a long time, and I know my way around a DSLR well enough to shoot images to illustrate my own stories if needs be (as I did [for VICE last year](http://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/shadowing-boomtown-security-279)), which is a standard I’m happy with.
* **Social media**: fair. Apart from running my own accounts, I've run social media campaigns for various organisations, and handled analytics etc too.
* **Blogging**: strong. You’re reading this aren’t you? Seriously though, besides standard CMSs like WordPress, this blog runs on Jekyll so I write posts in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and host on Github Pages, for which I’m awarding myself ‘blogger points’.
* **Video**: weak. I can shoot footage that looks nice, but I don’t know my way around an editing suite all that well. This is such a skill in itself that I don’t currently have time to learn.
* **Interviews**: fair. I've interviewed a few people for articles but I could do with more practice.
* **Training and facilitating**: strong. I've run various workshops to teach some of the above skills, in the UK and abroad, and for the most part loved doing it.
* **Project management**: fair. I've led on a few projects in the past and managed some small teams, but again, could learn a lot more.

When I list my skills like that, what I see is that a lot of them are geared towards the content production end of things, with a bit of management and interpersonal stuff. There's more weighting towards the recording and presenting of information with less emphasis on research, and equally, though being digital, the bulk of it is end-user stuff but falls short of any coder/maker skills.

So on the technical side of things, becoming a full-stack journalist means stepping up this side of things beyond being an end user or even a [power user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_user), to become an actual builder of websites, applications and experiences.

As I work towards this, here are some of the areas I’m covering:

* **HTML/CSS**: becoming competent in modern web design techniques.
* **JavaScript**: understanding enough to create interactive websites to showcase stories, particularly through data visualisation and geographical mapping.
* **Node.js / Express.js**: build up a working knowledge of these libraries in order to understand the basics of server administration and the [MEAN stack](http://mean.io/#!/).
* **Infosec**: get a more thorough handle on information security practice, not just for my own good, but to help teach others who deal with sensitive information.

And on the research side, here are a few areas I’m interested in learning more about:

* **Scraping databases**: learning how to extract information from the wealth of online public records available, and knowing how to find stories within them.
* **Lodging FOIA requests**: using the Freedom of Information Act in order to bring new information to light in the public interest.
* **Understanding company records**: being able to track corporate financial records more closely, and provide context to stories using information stored in company documents.

As a final point, increasingly I view the skills needed to explore new revenue streams and alternative business models as just as much a part of what it means to be a successful full-stack journalist as the previous points are. 

To this end, I’ll finish with a few things which are more in the category ‘to think about’ at the moment, but still very much on my radar:

* **BitCoin** and micro-payment systems.
* **Teaching** as a source of income.
* **Cross-funding** long term investigations with consultancy work.
* **Founding an e-business** as a location-independent revenue stream (see Tim Ferriss’s [‘Four Hour Work Week'](http://fourhourworkweek.com/) for more on this.)

Though the above points don’t fit into what we would usually call journalism, IMO they’re just the kind of things that young journalists should be considering in order to navigate their way through the emerging media landscape, and innovate the next big disruptive ideas in the field.

Hi, I'm **Corin**. In October 2015 I took a three month sabbatical from work in order to teach myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript, mostly by following courses from the [Treehouse learning platform](https://teamtreehouse.com/corinfaife).

Along the way I started this blog to write about what I was learning, and created a few [experimental projects](/categories/index.html#experiments) to showcase the skills I was working on.

As of January 2016 I've started to take freelance commissions for **web design**, **data visualisation** and **online articles**, but will continue to write here about design, code, politics, and especially the areas of overlap.

Hi. My name is **Corin**, and this is the start of a new blog.

Over the next 3 months, I'll be documenting the process of teaching myself JavaScript for data visualisation, with the aim of incorporating it into the freelance journalism I've been practising for the past few years.

Expect tutorials, code snippets, general thoughts, and frequent weeping into my keyboard.

Let the games begin...

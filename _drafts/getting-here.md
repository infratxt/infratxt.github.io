I started writing my first blog five years ago, in 2010, when I travelled solo in India for the second time. 

In the grand scheme of things it wasn’t much - a few anecdotes, a smattering of photos - but it still felt satisfying to be producing and uploading my own content, on a domain that I controlled.

In the years between then and now I’ve been working with digital media with an increasing level of skill and competency, first creating digital art with the Jaaga collective in Bangalore, then heading up editorial content for the sadly-now-defunct [Urban Times](http://www.urbantimes.co "Urban Times"), and over the past two years, leading on tech development stresategy for a citizen journalism NGO, [On Our Radar].

Above and around that I’ve completed a Masters in sociology at Goldsmiths (developing an [app for homeless young people] as a thesis project), and published a handful of freelance articles here and there. Though I can confidently say I’ve ‘worked in journalism’ for years, I’d stop short of calling myself a journalist.

In any case, much as I’ve always admired great journalism and great writing, it’s not what excites me most about journalism in the 21st century. The projects that captivate me are the ones that sit at the intersection of design and deep research; the projects where a great story or commentary is also told through great UX.
For a long time I’ve wanted not just to write stories, but to also have the skills to explore datasets, map and graph variables, and build websites to display the results. I don’t want to ditch the writing part - just add to it. That’s why I think of it not just as data journalism, but ‘full stack journalism’: being able to operate comfortably at all points of the spectrum which modern journalism encompasses.

In August 2015 my contract with On Our Radar expired, and four weeks later, at the end of the same month, I completed my Masters. Come September, I found myself in a rare situation: facing a completely clean break from everything I’d been doing over the past 2 years. 
Having been gifted with a natural career break, I decided to make the most of it by taking a sabbatical for a few months, and planning a crash course in the skills that I’ve been meaning to learn for a long time.
